# Difference between MongoDB and Mongoose
 * MongoDB is a NoSQL database system which stores data in the form of BSON documents
 * mongodb is the native driver for interacting with a mongodb instance 
   * It is the simplest to pick up. The downside here is that you will have to write larger amounts of code for validating the data, and the risk of errors is higher.
 * mongoose is an Object modeling tool for MongoDB.
   * a user can define the schema for the documents in a particular collection. It provides a lot of convenience in the creation and management of data in MongoDB. 
   * On the downside, learning mongoose can take some time, and has some limitations in handling schemas that are quite complex.
